# setlx2python - Convert setlx code to python

# TODO
- [ ] implement native setlx functions like print
- [ ] what to do with return outside a function?
- [ ] what to do with continue, break usw. outside function?
- [ ] lambdas
- [ ] sets,lists
- [ ] classes
- [ ] unpack procedure parameters
- [x] implication (=>)
- [x] boolean equal
- [x] CartesianProduct
- [ ] Terms
- [ ] vector
- [ ] matrix
- [ ] closure 
- [ ] cached procedure
- [ ] read/write procedure param
- [ ] procedureListParameter
- [ ] only print round brackets when needed (not every time)
- [x] calculate necessary imports
- [x] support multiple iterators in for loop
- [x] bug when transpiling tests/procedure.stlx
- [ ] implement own range function that behaves like setlx ranges
- [ ] condition problems (python does not requires booleans in conditions. e.g (None or 2) == 2. convert everything to bool?)
- [ ] deep copy procedure params (setlx call by value vs. python call by reference)
